*DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1*: My name is Shivam Shukla, and I have develope  an  "Interactive Quiz Application" as part of my learning journey in web development. I have prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, which gave me a strong foundation in building structured web pages and designing attractive interfaces. However, I am still in the process of learning the basics of JavaScript, and this project gave me the perfect opportunity to apply my growing skills into a practical, real-world project.This project is designed to provide users with a fun and educational experience. It allows them to attempt multiple-choice questions, track their scores, and compare results through a leaderboard system. I used HTML for structuring, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for logic and interactivity. Through this project, I not only applied my existing knowledge but also learned several new concepts, particularly in JavaScript, which helped me become more confident in coding.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML → For structuring the quiz screens (start screen, quiz screen, result screen).

CSS → For professional styling, animations, and responsive UI.

JavaScript → For quiz logic (questions, timer, scoring, leaderboard, interactivity).

Basically  I used tools like CHATGPT, CERTAIN WEBSITES , AND YOUTUBE and enjoyed it very much . It gives me confidence of learning this programming languages more conceptually.

THANK YOU.
